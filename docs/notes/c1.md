hymn to the sea: G#BC# is this a minor why it sounds major
 


# Curvature

the B E G F# E or more specifically the B E G group sounds magical. The E G transition goes up but feels like going down. I think there are 3 conditions that create this feel:
1. E has to be longer than B and G (playing all 4 at same interval gives no magical feeling, in greensleeve this is also true)
2. E to G has to be a minor 3rd ()
3. the fourth one has to go down (cp howl)

Similar thing can be heard in first bar of greesleeve. Curiously, after the EGA, the BCB feels lower. 

Short notes sound like connectives and long notes sound like the real vocabulary. But here with the minor 3rd 




Up (F major): FAFE (timing doesn't matter), FAED, DFDC
Amélie: E GF#G BCB
